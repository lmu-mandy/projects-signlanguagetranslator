**Sign Language Translator**

With the recent progress on applying Deep Learning to Natural Language Processing a portion of the population, those who are deaf, has not been able to benefit from some of these advancements. Here, the system will be proposed for this portion of the population from which they will be benefited a lot. From our system, transfer learning is used to accelerate training and improve results. The system will translate the action from video to text (word/alphabet) so that it helps those to understand from the action the person did.
